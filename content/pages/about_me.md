Annyeong! My name is John Peter, working
currently as a Year 1 medical physics resident
at St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network (SLRON), Rathgar.

My interests include outdoor activities such as
running, swimming, cycling, hiking and many more. I am able to
run 5k with a PB of 23 mins and 10k with a PB of 52 mins, slow I know but got to trust the process.

I was born on the main island of The Philippines but migrated
at an early age and was raised in the east coast of Ireland. 

Another passion of mine is photography, so checkout my IG account and give me a like and a follow!
DM me for questions.
