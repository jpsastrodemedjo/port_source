Hi! My name is John Peter, having finished my MSc degree I am now currently working as a Year 1 medical physics resident
at St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network (SLRON), Rathgar in Dublin, Ireland.

My interests include outdoor activities such as
running, swimming, cycling, hiking and many more. Another passion of mine is photography, so checkout my IG account and give me a like and a follow!

So the goal of this site is to post Python codes used in the field of medical physics. All code snippets in this site will be written in Python.

If you want to reach me, you can contact me via jskehr18@gmail.com
