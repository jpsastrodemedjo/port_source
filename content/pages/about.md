Hi! My name is John Peter, having finished my MSc degree I am now currently working as a Year 1 medical physics resident
at St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network (SLRON), Rathgar in Dublin, Ireland.

My interests include outdoor activities such as
running, swimming, cycling, hiking and many more. Here are some of my PBs:  
5k - 23 mins    
10k - 52 mins   
Another passion of mine is photography, so checkout my IG account and give me a like and a follow!

So the goal of this blog is mainly to document my progress throughout the residency. Most articles about this blog will consist of content from each competency that I will complete, i.e. in this blog I will be providing educational materials and code for those who want to learn more about medical physics. All code snippets in this site will be written in Python.
